# CSC305_Spring_2019
So this is my work for CSC305. Honestly speaking it's an easy course with quite interesting contents. My professor is Li Ji(phonetic pun means lucky or in Chinese 吉利) who is a very friendly professor. I got full marks in the first and third assignment, but for the second one I didn't meet all requirements and achieved only 60% percent because I missed a lab to have buffet with Yang Yang in a curry restaurant uptown. I shouldn't have skipped that lab and the marks made me frustrated :-P. So I went for TA's help often and hopefully got a satisfying result in the final. Cheers.
